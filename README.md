# Pyriod

Python implementation of basic period detection and fitting routines for astronomical time series.

<!---Give it a spin before you install [with Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/keatonb/Pyriod/HEAD?filepath=examples%2FTSC2_Demo.ipynb).--->

To install, use

```pip install Pyriod```

or download the latest (possibly unstable) version from GitHub and run

```python setup.py install```

Additional documentation is available at [pyriod.readthedocs.io](https://pyriod.readthedocs.io).

This code uses [Qgrid](https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid) and other Jupyter widgets to interactively display the frequency solution.  
Unfortunately Qgrid is no longer supported. We are grateful to @zhihanyue for maintaining [qgridnext](https://github.com/zhihanyue/qgridnext).
