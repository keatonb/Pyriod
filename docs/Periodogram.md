### The Periodogram widget

The Periodogram cell allows you to interact with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Click on a peak to stage a signal for addition to the model.  Click the "Add to solution" button to add the staged signal to the signals table, and click "Refine fit" to optimize the frequency/amplitude/phase values with a least-squares fit.


Under the "options" tab, you can choose which periodograms to display: the periodogram of the original data (gray), of the current residuals (time series data - model; blue), or of the current model sampled as the data (green). You can also select whether to display markers for the current set of signal frequencies and amplitudes, and whether clicks to stage signals snap to the nearest peaks or stage the exact frequency location of the click.


In the near future there will be additional options for assessing the signal-to-noise of peaks and determining a significance threshold.
